## Fields

### fn withAudiences

```ts
withAudiences(audiences)
```

"Audiences are the intendend audiences of the token. A recipient of a token must identitfy themself with an identifier in the list of audiences of the token, and otherwise should reject the token. A token issued for multiple audiences may be used to authenticate against any of the audiences listed but implies a high degree of trust between the target audiences."

### fn withAudiencesMixin

```ts
withAudiencesMixin(audiences)
```

"Audiences are the intendend audiences of the token. A recipient of a token must identitfy themself with an identifier in the list of audiences of the token, and otherwise should reject the token. A token issued for multiple audiences may be used to authenticate against any of the audiences listed but implies a high degree of trust between the target audiences."

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values
