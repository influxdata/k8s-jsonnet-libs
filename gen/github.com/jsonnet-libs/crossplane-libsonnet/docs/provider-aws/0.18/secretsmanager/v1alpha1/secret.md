```ts
new(name)
```

new returns an instance of Secret

## obj metadata

"ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create."

### fn metadata.withAnnotations

```ts
withAnnotations(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

### fn metadata.withAnnotationsMixin

```ts
withAnnotationsMixin(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withClusterName

```ts
withClusterName(clusterName)
```

"The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request."

### fn metadata.withCreationTimestamp

```ts
withCreationTimestamp(creationTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds

```ts
withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds(deletionGracePeriodSeconds)
```

"Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only."

### fn metadata.withDeletionTimestamp

```ts
withDeletionTimestamp(deletionTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withFinalizers

```ts
withFinalizers(finalizers)
```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list."

### fn metadata.withFinalizersMixin

```ts
withFinalizersMixin(finalizers)
```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list.

### fn metadata.withGenerateName

```ts
withGenerateName(generateName)
```

"GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.\n\nIf this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).\n\nApplied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency"

### fn metadata.withName

```ts
withName(name)
```

"Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names"

### fn metadata.withNamespace

```ts
withNamespace(namespace)
```

"Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \"default\" namespace, but \"default\" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.\n\nMust be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces"

### fn metadata.withOwnerReferences

```ts
withOwnerReferences(ownerReferences)
```

"List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller."

### fn metadata.withOwnerReferencesMixin

```ts
withOwnerReferencesMixin(ownerReferences)
```

"List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected.

### fn metadata.withResourceVersion

```ts
withResourceVersion(resourceVersion)
```

"An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.\n\nPopulated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency"

### fn metadata.withSelfLink

```ts
withSelfLink(selfLink)
```

"SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.\n\nDEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release."

### fn metadata.withUid

```ts
withUid(uid)
```

"UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.\n\nPopulated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids"

## obj spec

"SecretSpec defines the desired state of Secret"

### fn spec.withDeletionPolicy

```ts
withDeletionPolicy(deletionPolicy)
```

"DeletionPolicy specifies what will happen to the underlying external when this managed resource is deleted - either \"Delete\" or \"Orphan\" the external resource. The \"Delete\" policy is the default when no policy is specified."

## obj spec.forProvider

"SecretParameters defines the desired state of Secret"

### fn spec.forProvider.withDescription

```ts
withDescription(description)
```

"(Optional) Specifies a user-provided description of the secret."

### fn spec.forProvider.withForceDeleteWithoutRecovery

```ts
withForceDeleteWithoutRecovery(forceDeleteWithoutRecovery)
```

"(Optional) Specifies that the secret is to be deleted without any recovery window. You can't use both this parameter and the RecoveryWindowInDays parameter in the same API call. \n An asynchronous background process performs the actual deletion, so there can be a short delay before the operation completes. If you write code to delete and then immediately recreate a secret with the same name, ensure that your code includes appropriate back off and retry logic. \n Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the operation to skip the normal waiting period before the permanent deletion that AWS would normally impose with the RecoveryWindowInDays parameter. If you delete a secret with the ForceDeleteWithouRecovery parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret. It is permanently lost."

### fn spec.forProvider.withKmsKeyID

```ts
withKmsKeyID(kmsKeyID)
```

"(Optional) Specifies the ARN, Key ID, or alias of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) to be used to encrypt the SecretString or SecretBinary values in the versions stored in this secret. \n You can specify any of the supported ways to identify a AWS KMS key ID. If you need to reference a CMK in a different account, you can use only the key ARN or the alias ARN. \n If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager defaults to using the AWS account's default CMK (the one named aws/secretsmanager). If a AWS KMS CMK with that name doesn't yet exist, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically the first time it needs to encrypt a version's SecretString or SecretBinary fields. \n You can use the account default CMK to encrypt and decrypt only if you call this operation using credentials from the same account that owns the secret. If the secret resides in a different account, then you must create a custom CMK and specify the ARN in this field."

### fn spec.forProvider.withRecoveryWindowInDays

```ts
withRecoveryWindowInDays(recoveryWindowInDays)
```

"(Optional) Specifies the number of days that Secrets Manager waits before it can delete the secret. You can't use both this parameter and the ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery parameter in the same API call. \n This value can range from 7 to 30 days. The default value is 30."

### fn spec.forProvider.withRegion

```ts
withRegion(region)
```

"Region is which region the Secret will be created."

### fn spec.forProvider.withTags

```ts
withTags(tags)
```

"(Optional) Specifies a list of user-defined tags that are attached to the secret. Each tag is a \"Key\" and \"Value\" pair of strings. This operation only appends tags to the existing list of tags. To remove tags, you must use UntagResource. \n    * Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key    \"ABC\" is a different tag from one with key \"abc\". \n    * If you check tags in IAM policy Condition elements as part of your security    strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the    successful completion of this operation would result in you losing your    permissions for this secret, then this operation is blocked and returns    an Access Denied error. \n This parameter requires a JSON text string argument. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json) in the AWS CLI User Guide. For example: \n [{\"Key\":\"CostCenter\",\"Value\":\"12345\"},{\"Key\":\"environment\",\"Value\":\"production\"}] \n If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. \n The following basic restrictions apply to tags: \n    * Maximum number of tags per secret—50 \n    * Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters in UTF-8 \n    * Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters in UTF-8 \n    * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. \n    * Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values because AWS reserves    it for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this    prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret    limit. \n    * If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and resources,    remember other services might have restrictions on allowed characters.    Generally allowed characters: letters, spaces, and numbers representable    in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @."

### fn spec.forProvider.withTagsMixin

```ts
withTagsMixin(tags)
```

"(Optional) Specifies a list of user-defined tags that are attached to the secret. Each tag is a \"Key\" and \"Value\" pair of strings. This operation only appends tags to the existing list of tags.
