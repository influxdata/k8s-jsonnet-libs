## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new(name)
```

new returns an instance of Authorizer

## obj metadata

"ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create."

### fn metadata.withAnnotations

```ts
withAnnotations(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

### fn metadata.withAnnotationsMixin

```ts
withAnnotationsMixin(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withClusterName

```ts
withClusterName(clusterName)
```

"The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request."

### fn metadata.withCreationTimestamp

```ts
withCreationTimestamp(creationTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds

```ts
withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds(deletionGracePeriodSeconds)
```

"Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only."

### fn metadata.withDeletionTimestamp

```ts
withDeletionTimestamp(deletionTimestamp)

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withFinalizers

```ts
withFinalizers(finalizers)
```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list."

### fn metadata.withFinalizersMixin

```ts
withFinalizersMixin(finalizers)
```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list.

### fn metadata.withGenerateName

```ts
withGenerateName(generateName)
```

"GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.\n\nIf this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).\n\nApplied only if Name is not specified.

Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names"

### fn metadata.withNamespace

```ts
withNamespace(namespace)
```

"Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \"default\" namespace, but \"default\" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.\n\nMust be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces"

### fn metadata.withOwnerReferences

```ts
withOwnerReferences(ownerReferences)
```

"List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected.

### fn spec.forProvider.withAuthorizerResultTtlInSeconds

```ts
withAuthorizerResultTtlInSeconds(authorizerResultTtlInSeconds)
```

"The TTL in seconds of cached authorizer results. If it equals 0, authorization caching is disabled. If it is greater than 0, API Gateway will cache authorizer responses. If this field is not set, the default value is 300. The maximum value is 3600, or 1 hour."

### fn spec.forProvider.withAuthorizerURI

```ts
withAuthorizerURI(authorizerURI)
```

"Specifies the authorizer's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). For TOKEN or REQUEST authorizers, this must be a well-formed Lambda function URI, for example, arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:{account_id}:function:{lambda_function_name}/invocations. In general, the URI has this form arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:lambda:path/{service_api}, where {region} is the same as the region hosting the Lambda function, path indicates that the remaining substring in the URI should be treated as the path to the resource, including the initial /. For Lambda functions, this is usually of the form /2015-03-31/functions/[FunctionARN]/invocations."

### fn spec.forProvider.withIdentitySource

```ts
withIdentitySource(identitySource)
```

"The identity source for which authorization is requested. * For a TOKEN or COGNITO_USER_POOLS authorizer, this is required and specifies the request header mapping expression for the custom header holding the authorization token submitted by the client. For example, if the token header name is Auth, the header mapping expression is method.request.header.Auth. \n * For the REQUEST authorizer, this is required when authorization caching is enabled. The value is a comma-separated string of one or more mapping expressions of the specified request parameters. For example, if an Auth header, a Name query string parameter are defined as identity sources, this value is method.request.header.Auth, method.request.querystring.Name. These parameters will be used to derive the authorization caching key and to perform runtime validation of the REQUEST authorizer by verifying all of the identity-related request parameters are present, not null and non-empty. Only when this is true does the authorizer invoke the authorizer Lambda function, otherwise, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response without calling the Lambda function. The valid value is a string of comma-separated mapping expressions of the specified request parameters. When the authorization caching is not enabled, this property is optional."

### fn spec.forProvider.withIdentityValidationExpression

```ts
withIdentityValidationExpression(identityValidationExpression)
```

"A validation expression for the incoming identity token. For TOKEN authorizers, this value is a regular expression. For COGNITO_USER_POOLS authorizers, API Gateway will match the aud field of the incoming token from the client against the specified regular expression. It will invoke the authorizer's Lambda function when there is a match. Otherwise, it will return a 401 Unauthorized response without calling the Lambda function. The validation expression does not apply to the REQUEST authorizer."
