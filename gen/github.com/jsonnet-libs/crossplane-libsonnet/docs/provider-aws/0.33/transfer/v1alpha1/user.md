### fn metadata.withAnnotationsMixin

```ts
withAnnotationsMixin(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withClusterName

```ts
withClusterName(clusterName)
```

"The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request."

### fn metadata.withCreationTimestamp

```ts
withCreationTimestamp(creationTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds

```ts
withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds(deletionGracePeriodSeconds)

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withFinalizers

```ts
withFinalizers(finalizers)
```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list."

### fn metadata.withGenerateName

```ts
withGenerateName(generateName)
```

"GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.\n\nIf this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).\n\nApplied only if Name is not specified.

Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names"

### fn metadata.withNamespace

```ts
withNamespace(namespace)
```

"Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \"default\" namespace, but \"default\" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.\n\nMust be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces"

### fn metadata.withOwnerReferences

```ts
withOwnerReferences(ownerReferences)
```

Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency"

### fn metadata.withSelfLink

```ts
withSelfLink(selfLink)
```

### fn spec.forProvider.withHomeDirectoryMappings

```ts
withHomeDirectoryMappings(homeDirectoryMappings)
```

"Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target. This value can only be set when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. \n The following is an Entry and Target pair example. \n [ { \"Entry\": \"/directory1\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ] \n In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory (\"chroot\"). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value. \n The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot. \n [ { \"Entry:\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ] \n If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the s3api or efsapi call instead of s3 or efs so you can use the put-object operation. For example, you use the following: aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a / for it to be considered a folder."

```ts
withHomeDirectoryType(homeDirectoryType)
```

"The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to PATH, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visible to your users."

### fn spec.forProvider.withPolicy

```ts
withPolicy(policy)
```

"A session policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM role across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName}, ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and ${Transfer:HomeBucket}. \n This only applies when the domain of ServerId is S3. EFS does not use session policies. \n For session policies, Amazon Web Services Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument. \n For an example of a session policy, see Example session policy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/session-policy.html). \n For more information, see AssumeRole (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) in the Amazon Web Services Security Token Service API Reference."
