## Fields

### fn withStrategy

```ts
withStrategy(strategy)
```

"Strategy is the strategy to use. One of \"OnPodCompletion\", \"OnPodSuccess\", \"OnWorkflowCompletion\", \"OnWorkflowSuccess\

## obj labelSelector

"A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects."

### fn labelSelector.withMatchExpressions

```ts
withMatchExpressions(matchExpressions)
```

"matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed."

### fn labelSelector.withMatchExpressionsMixin

```ts
withMatchExpressionsMixin(matchExpressions)
```

"matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed."

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn labelSelector.withMatchLabels

```ts
withMatchLabels(matchLabels)
```

"matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is \"key\", the operator is \"In\", and the values array contains only \"value\". The requirements are ANDed."

### fn labelSelector.withMatchLabelsMixin

```ts
withMatchLabelsMixin(matchLabels)
```

"matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is \"key\", the operator is \"In\", and the values array contains only \"value\". The requirements are ANDed."
