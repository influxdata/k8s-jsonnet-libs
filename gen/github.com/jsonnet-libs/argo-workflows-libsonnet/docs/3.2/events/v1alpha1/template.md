The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw----\n\nIf unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume."

### fn securityContext.withRunAsGroup

```ts
withRunAsGroup(runAsGroup)
```

"The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default if unset. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container."

### fn securityContext.withRunAsNonRoot

```ts
withRunAsNonRoot(runAsNonRoot)
```

"Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence."

### fn securityContext.withRunAsUser

```ts
withRunAsUser(runAsUser)
```

"The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container."

### fn securityContext.withSupplementalGroups

```ts
withSupplementalGroups(supplementalGroups)
```

"A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in addition to the container's primary GID.  If unspecified, no groups will be added to any container."

### fn securityContext.withSupplementalGroupsMixin

```ts
withSupplementalGroupsMixin(supplementalGroups)
```

"A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in addition to the container's primary GID.  If unspecified, no groups will be added to any container."

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn securityContext.withSysctls

```ts
withSysctls(sysctls)
```

### fn securityContext.withSysctlsMixin

```ts
withSysctlsMixin(sysctls)

"Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with unsupported sysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch."

```

"Level is SELinux level label that applies to the container."

### fn securityContext.seLinuxOptions.withRole

```ts
withRole(role)
```

"Role is a SELinux role label that applies to the container."

### fn securityContext.seLinuxOptions.withType

```ts

## obj securityContext.windowsOptions

"WindowsSecurityContextOptions contain Windows-specific options and credentials."

### fn securityContext.windowsOptions.withGmsaCredentialSpec

```ts

```

"GMSACredentialSpec is where the GMSA admission webhook (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/windows-gmsa) inlines the contents of the GMSA credential spec named by the GMSACredentialSpecName field. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the WindowsGMSA feature flag."

### fn securityContext.windowsOptions.withGmsaCredentialSpecName

```ts

```

"GMSACredentialSpecName is the name of the GMSA credential spec to use. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the WindowsGMSA feature flag."

### fn securityContext.windowsOptions.withRunAsUserName
